1. Container is a component that has direct access to the state that produce by redux
2. Only create container out of components that cares about a particular piece of state (ONLY THE MOST PARENT COMPONENT)
    ex: BooksList = Cares about when the list of books changes
        BookDetail = cares about when the active book changes

3.   Redux serves to construct the application state,
     React provides the views to display that state

4. Our application state is generated by the reducer function
5. Action Creator is a function that returns an action in OBJECT
6. BindActionCreators is used to make sure that the action we created (in object) actually flows to all reducers
7. Action have 2 values : payload: clarify the condition of the action that being triggered (what is being actioned?)
                          type: describe the purpose of the action
